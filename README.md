# Basty7's Arch+Hyprland dotfiles

Welcome to my dotfiles repository for Arch Linux with Hyprland!
You are welcome to use and modify these dotfiles as you want.
Those are meant to be used with the stow command: it will create symlinks so you can centralize your config files in one folder.
Symply `stow <folder-name>` each folder for which you want the settings to be applied.
  Example (in ~/dotfiles) : to apply waybar config, cd to dotfiles folder and run `stow waybar`

Programs used:
- Arch Linux as main OS
- Hyprland as Window Manager
- hyprpaper as wallpaper manager
- waybar as status bar
- tofi as app Launcher, power menu, clipboard selector (requires clipman)
- kitty as TTY emulator
- starship for $PS1 customization
- ~Firefox~ --> Zen browser. You can still find userChrome to make the firefox toolbar transparent in here
- xdg-menu as app menu (I don't use it so often though)

## Big thanks to the Catpuccin project for providing color schemes
